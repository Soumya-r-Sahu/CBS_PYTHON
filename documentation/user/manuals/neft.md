# 🔄 NEFT Payments Module Implementation Guide

> **Status:** In Progress | **Target Completion:** July 2025 | **Owner:** Payments Team

---

## 📖 Overview
This guide provides best practices and step-by-step instructions for implementing the NEFT Payments module in CBS_PYTHON using Clean Architecture and domain-driven design principles.

---

## 🧩 Clean Architecture Alignment
- **Domain Layer:** Define entities (NEFTTransaction, Beneficiary), value objects, and business rules for NEFT payments.
- **Application Layer:** Implement use cases (initiate payment, validate beneficiary, process batch, refund).
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Develop repository implementations, payment gateway adapters, and batch processors.
- **Presentation Layer:** Build REST API endpoints and CLI/web interfaces for NEFT operations.

---

## 🗺️ Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Domain Layer
- [ ] Define entities: NEFTTransaction, Beneficiary
- [ ] Create value objects: IFSCCode, AccountNumber, PaymentStatus
- [ ] Implement domain services: NEFTValidationService, BatchProcessor
- [ ] Add domain events: PaymentInitiated, PaymentProcessed, PaymentFailed

### 2️⃣ Application Layer
- [ ] Define repository interfaces: NEFTTransactionRepository, BeneficiaryRepository
- [ ] Implement use cases: InitiatePayment, ValidateBeneficiary, ProcessBatch, RefundPayment
- [ ] Add DTOs for requests and responses

### 3️⃣ Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] Implement repositories (SQLAlchemy, external payment gateway integration)
- [ ] Integrate with batch processing and notification services
- [ ] Add security features (transaction validation, audit logging)

### 4️⃣ Presentation Layer
- [ ] Build REST API endpoints for all use cases
- [ ] Develop CLI/web interface for NEFT operations
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### 5️⃣ Testing & Security
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all layers
- [ ] Conduct security audits (transaction integrity, fraud detection)
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Enforce strict beneficiary validation
- Use secure channels for payment processing
- Implement transaction monitoring and fraud detection
- Log all critical actions for audit
