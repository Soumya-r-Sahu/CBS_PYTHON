## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Completion | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1     | Core Infrastructure | Week 1 | ‚úÖ Completed |
| 2     | Interface Updates | Week 2 | ‚úÖ Completed |
| 3     | Data Model Updates | Week 3 | ‚úèÔ∏è In Progress |
| 4     | API and Service Layer | Week 4 | ‚è≥ Scheduled |
| 5     | Testing and Monitoring | Week 5 | ‚è≥ Scheduled |
| 6     | Documentation and Training | Week 6 | ‚è≥ Scheduled |

## Implementation Priorities

1. **High Priority**
   - SQLAlchemy model environment awareness
   - Migration script safety checks
   - Environment-specific validation rules

2. **Medium Priority**
   - API environment headers
   - Environment-specific seed data
   - Service layer environment configuration

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Monitoring and metrics
   - Documentation updates
   - Training materials

## Resource Allocation

| Resource | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Phase 6 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Backend Developers | 100% | 80% | 50% | 20% |
| Frontend Developers | 20% | 70% | 50% | 30% |
| QA Engineers | 40% | 60% | 100% | 30% |
| DevOps | 30% | 50% | 80% | 20% |
| Documentation | 10% | 30% | 50% | 100% |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Production data exposure | High | Low | Strict environment validation, prefixed tables |
| Environment detection failure | Medium | Low | Fallback detection mechanisms |
| Performance overhead | Low | Medium | Performance testing per environment |
| Development complexity | Medium | Medium | Clear documentation, examples, training |
| Database schema conflicts | High | Medium | Environment-specific prefixes, migration testing |

## Success Metrics

- All modules report correct environment
- No cross-environment data leakage
- 100% of tests pass in all environments
- All user interfaces show appropriate environment indicators
- Zero production issues related to environment confusion

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing environment awareness across all parts of the Core Banking System. By following this plan, we will ensure proper isolation between environments, clear visual indicators, and appropriate behavior constraints based on the running environment.
