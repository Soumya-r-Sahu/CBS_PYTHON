# Banking ID Standards 📜

This document outlines the standards for generating and managing banking IDs in CBS_PYTHON.

## Guidelines 📋

1. **Unique Identifiers**: Ensure all banking IDs are unique.
2. **Format**: Use a consistent format for all IDs.
3. **Validation**: Implement validation checks for all IDs.

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **ID Validator Implementation**
   - Updated `app/lib/id_validator.py` with improved validation functions for all ID types
   - Added integration with `utils/id_utils.py` for code reusability
   - Implemented proper validation for:
     - Customer IDs (YYDDD-BBBBB-SSSS)
     - Account Numbers (BBBBB-AATT-CCCCCC-CC)
     - Transaction IDs (TRX-YYYYMMDD-SSSSSS)
     - Employee IDs (ZZBB-DD-EEEE)
     - IFSC Codes
     - IBAN formats
     - SWIFT/BIC codes
     - UPI IDs

2. ✅ **Test Suite Creation**
   - Created `tests/test_id_validation.py` to verify validation functions
   - Implemented tests for all ID types and formats
   - Added handling for both valid and invalid test cases

3. ✅ **Documentation**
   - Created `docs/id_format_standards.md` with comprehensive information about all ID formats
   - Created `docs/id_format_migration_guide.md` with detailed migration steps and timeline
   - Documented checksum calculation algorithm and code

4. ✅ **Integration**
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code
   - Added alias functions for smooth transition
   - Created proper imports and fallbacks for robustness

## Remaining Tasks

1. 📝 **Database Migration Testing**
   - Test the migration script with representative test data
   - Measure performance on large datasets
   - Fine-tune error handling and rollback procedures

2. 📝 **Frontend and API Updates**
   - Update all forms and displays to handle the new ID formats
   - Update API documentation with the new ID formats
   - Test client applications with the new ID formats

3. 📝 **User Training**
   - Create training materials for staff about the new ID formats
   - Schedule training sessions for customer service representatives

4. 📝 **Monitoring and Support**
   - Implement logging for ID validation failures during the transition
   - Create a support plan for addressing issues during the migration
   - Set up monitoring dashboards to track migration progress

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. Run and test the ID format migration script on a test database
2. Update any remaining references to old ID formats in the code
3. Conduct a code review of the validation and generation functions
4. Update the project documentation with the new ID standards

## Notes

- The checksum calculation for account numbers uses the Luhn algorithm
- The migration is scheduled for May 15, 2025
- All validation functions are now integrated with the central utilities module
- Backward compatibility is maintained through alias functions
