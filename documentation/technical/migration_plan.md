# Migration Plan for Existing CBS_PYTHON Code

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to migrate existing code to use our new unified components and design patterns. This phased approach ensures minimal disruption while gradually improving code quality and consistency.

## Phase 1: Preparation and Education

### Documentation and Training
1. Create detailed documentation for all new components and patterns
2. Conduct training sessions for the development team
3. Create examples for common use cases
4. Set up a channel for migration-related questions and support

### Setup Tooling
1. Implement automated linting with new rules
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline for testing
3. Create migration helper scripts
4. Establish automated reporting for migration progress

## Phase 2: Migration by Feature Area

### Error Handling Migration
1. Create adapter classes for existing error types to new exceptions
2. Replace imports in one module at a time
3. Update error handling code to use new patterns
4. Update API endpoint error responses to use new format

**Example:**
```python
# Before
try:
    # operation
except UpiBaseException as e:
    return {"error": e.message, "code": e.code}

# After
try:
    # operation
except CBSException as e:
    return e.to_dict()
```

### Validator Migration
1. Create adapters from old validator functions to new validator classes
2. Replace direct function calls one module at a time
3. Update validation logic to use the new composable approach
4. Refactor complex validation to use schema validators

**Example:**
```python
# Before
is_valid, error = validate_amount(amount, 0.01, 100000.0)

# After (transition phase)
is_valid, error = LegacyValidatorAdapter.adapt_amount(amount, 0.01, 100000.0)

# After (full migration)
amount_validator = RangeValidator(min_value=0.01, max_value=100000.0)
is_valid, error = amount_validator.validate(amount)
```

### Design Pattern Migration
1. Identify classes that should be singletons
2. Apply factory pattern to object creation methods
3. Implement observer pattern for notification systems
4. Apply strategy pattern to variable algorithms

**Example:**
```python
# Before
class Logger:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Logger, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance._initialize()
        return cls._instance

# After
from utils.common.design_patterns import singleton

@singleton
class Logger:
    def __init__(self):
        self._initialize()
```

### Dependency Injection Migration
1. Identify components with tight coupling
2. Create interfaces for key services
3. Implement dependency injection container
4. Refactor constructor code to use DI

**Example:**
```python
# Before
class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = Database()
        self.logger = Logger()
        self.validator = Validator()

# After
class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, db, logger, validator):
        self.db = db
        self.logger = logger
        self.validator = validator

# In composition root:
container.register(Database, PostgresDatabase)
container.register_singleton(Logger, FileLogger)
container.register(Validator, TransactionValidator)

processor = container.resolve(PaymentProcessor)
```

## Phase 3: Incremental Completion

### Integration Testing
1. Create tests for migrated components
2. Verify backward compatibility
3. Test integration between migrated and non-migrated modules
4. Performance testing of new implementations

### Completion by Module
Start with non-critical modules and gradually move to more critical ones:
1. Utils and helper modules
2. Internal-facing services
3. API and external-facing services
4. Core banking modules

### Code Reviews and Quality Assurance
1. Perform focused code reviews on migrated modules
2. Run automated tests on all changes
3. Verify error handling and edge cases
4. Ensure documentation is updated

## Phase 4: Cleanup and Optimization

### Remove Legacy Code
1. Remove adapter modules after migration is complete
2. Clean up deprecated methods and classes
3. Update all imports to use new modules directly

### Optimize Performance
1. Review memoization opportunities 
2. Add caching for expensive operations
3. Optimize database queries
4. Fine-tune dependency injection

### Documentation Finalization
1. Update all API documentation
2. Create architectural diagrams showing new patterns
3. Update developer onboarding materials
4. Document lessons learned from migration

## Migration Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Completion Criteria |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Phase 1: Preparation | 2 weeks | Team training complete, tools set up |
| Phase 2: First Module | 2 weeks | One module fully migrated and tested |
| Phase 2: Remaining Modules | 8-12 weeks | All modules migrated |
| Phase 3: Testing and Integration | 4 weeks | All integration tests passing |
| Phase 4: Cleanup | 2 weeks | Legacy code removed, documentation complete |

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. Regression bugs during migration
2. Performance issues with new patterns
3. Team resistance to new patterns
4. Timeline delays due to unforeseen complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive test coverage before and after migration
2. Performance benchmarking at each stage
3. Regular training and support sessions
4. Phased approach with clear milestones

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to update the CBS_PYTHON codebase to use the new unified error handling, design patterns, and other improvements. By following this phased approach, we can minimize disruption while gradually improving code quality and consistency.

The migration will result in a more maintainable, testable, and robust codebase that follows modern software engineering practices.
