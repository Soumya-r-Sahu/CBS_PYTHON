# Utility Consolidation

This document describes the utility consolidation work performed on the CBS_PYTHON codebase.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to reduce code duplication by consolidating common utility functions that were repeated across different banking modules into centralized utility files.

## Centralized Utility Structure

All common utilities are now organized in the `utils/common/` directory:

```
utils/
├── common/
│   ├── __init__.py         # Exports all common utilities
│   ├── id_formatters.py    # ID formatting & masking functions
│   ├── validators.py       # Validation functions
│   └── encryption.py       # Encryption/decryption functions
```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated repeated code across modules
- **Standardization**: Enforced consistent utility implementations
- **Maintainability**: Single location for fixes and improvements
- **Performance**: Optimized implementations shared across the system

## Usage Guidelines

Always import utilities from the centralized location:

```python
# Correct way to import utilities
from utils.common.validators import validate_account_number
from utils.common.encryption import encrypt_sensitive_data

# Do NOT create local copies of these functions
```
