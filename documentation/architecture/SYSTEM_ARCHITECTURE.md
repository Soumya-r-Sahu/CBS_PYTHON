*Note: You will need to add this diagram image file after GitHub repository setup.*

## Key Components

The CBS_PYTHON system is organized into several key domains, each with its own responsibility:

### Core Banking Domain
The central component of the system, handling fundamental banking operations:
- **Accounts Module**: Account creation, management, and operations
- **Customer Management Module**: Customer data, KYC, onboarding
- **Loans Module**: Loan origination, servicing, and collection
- **Transactions Module**: Financial transaction processing

### Digital Channels Domain
User-facing interfaces for customers to interact with the banking system:
- **ATM Switch**: Interface with ATM networks
- **Internet Banking**: Web-based banking services
- **Mobile Banking**: Mobile app banking services

### Payments Domain
Payment processing services:
- **UPI**: Unified Payments Interface implementation
- **NEFT**: National Electronic Funds Transfer
- **RTGS**: Real-Time Gross Settlement
- **IMPS**: Immediate Payment Service

### Risk & Compliance Domain
Risk management and regulatory compliance:
- **Fraud Detection**: ML-based fraud prevention
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Compliance reporting
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive activity logging

### Integration Interfaces
External system connections:
- **API Layer**: REST APIs for integration
- **File-Based Interfaces**: Batch file processing
- **Message Queue Interfaces**: Async messaging

## Component Interactions

### Customer Journey Flow

1. **Customer Onboarding**:
   - Digital Channels → Customer Management → Risk & Compliance

2. **Account Opening**:
   - Customer Management → Accounts → Regulatory Reporting

3. **Funds Deposit**:
   - Digital Channels → Accounts → Transactions → Audit Trail

4. **Fund Transfer**:
   - Digital Channels → Payments → Accounts → Transactions → Audit Trail

5. **Loan Application**:
   - Digital Channels → Customer Management → Loans → Risk & Compliance

## Data Flow

The system employs Clean Architecture principles with a clear flow of data:

1. **Request Flow**: User Interface → Use Cases → Domain Logic → Infrastructure
2. **Response Flow**: Infrastructure → Domain Logic → Use Cases → User Interface

## Deployment Architecture

The CBS_PYTHON system can be deployed in various configurations:

### Development Environment
- Single-server deployment
- SQLite database
- Debug logging enabled

### Test Environment
- Multi-server deployment
- PostgreSQL database
- End-to-end testing infrastructure
- Sandbox integrations with external systems

### Production Environment
- Highly available multi-server deployment
- PostgreSQL with replication
- Load balancing
- Disaster recovery
- Production integrations with banking networks

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for APIs, session-based for UI
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Audit**: Comprehensive audit logging
5. **Input Validation**: Strict validation at all entry points

## Future Architecture Plans

1. **Microservices Migration**: Gradually moving to microservices architecture
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implementing event sourcing and CQRS
3. **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Containerization and orchestration
4. **AI/ML Integration**: Expanding machine learning capabilities
