## Key Principles üìú

| Principle       | Description                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Scalability** | Designed to handle growth       |
| **Modularity**  | Loosely coupled components      |
| **Security**    | Adheres to industry standards   |

## Key Architecture Principles

The Core Banking System follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each banking function is implemented as a separate module
2. **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns between layers
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic organized around banking domain concepts
4. **API-First**: All functionality accessible via well-defined APIs
5. **Security by Design**: Security built into the architecture from the ground up

## System Architecture Overview

The Core Banking System architecture consists of the following layers:

### Presentation Layer
- User interfaces (Web, Mobile, ATM)
- API Gateway
- External Service Integration Points

### Application Layer
- Service Orchestration
- Business Process Management
- API Controllers
- DTOs and Mappers

### Domain Layer
- Business Logic
- Domain Models
- Domain Services
- Domain Events

### Infrastructure Layer
- Data Access
- External Service Integration
- Security
- Logging and Monitoring

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed as a set of microservices with:

- Containerization using Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes
- Service Mesh for inter-service communication
- API Gateway for external access
- Load Balancing and Auto-scaling

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- Network Security (Firewalls, VPNs)
- Application Security (Authentication, Authorization)
- Data Security (Encryption at rest and in transit)
- Audit Logging
- Intrusion Detection

## Integration Architecture

The system integrates with external systems through:

- RESTful APIs
- Message Queues
- File-based Integration
- Database Integration
- Third-party Service Connectors

## Design Patterns

The system implements various design patterns:

- Repository Pattern for data access
- Factory Pattern for object creation
- Strategy Pattern for algorithm selection
- Observer Pattern for event handling
- Command Pattern for operation encapsulation
