## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the CBS_PYTHON banking system from its current monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture. This migration will enable greater scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility while ensuring business continuity throughout the transition.

## 🎯 Migration Objectives

- Improve system scalability and fault isolation
- Enable independent deployment of banking modules
- Enhance development team autonomy and productivity
- Reduce technical debt through well-defined service boundaries
- Ensure business continuity with zero downtime migration
- Improve observability and operational efficiency

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Assessment

### Monolithic Components

The current CBS_PYTHON system operates primarily as a monolith with the following key characteristics:

- Tightly coupled core banking modules (accounts, loans, transactions)
- Shared database schemas across multiple functional domains
- Synchronous communication between system components
- Single deployment lifecycle for all functionality
- Limited isolation between critical and non-critical functions

### Pain Points

- Scaling challenges during peak transaction periods
- Extended deployment windows and coordination overhead
- Difficulty isolating failures in production environments
- Development bottlenecks with multiple teams working on shared codebase
- Long-running database transactions affecting overall system performance
- Testing complexity and increased regression risk

## 🛣️ Migration Approach: Strangler Fig Pattern

We will adopt the Strangler Fig migration pattern to gradually transition the monolith to microservices:

### Key Migration Phases:

1. **Foundation Setup (Q2 2025)**
   - Implement API gateway and service registry
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline for microservices
   - Set up observability infrastructure
   - Develop service mesh for inter-service communication

2. **Domain Identification (Q3 2025)**
   - Analyze business domains and bounded contexts
   - Define service boundaries and responsibilities
   - Map data ownership and access patterns
   - Identify domain events and integration points

3. **Incremental Extraction (Q4 2025 - Q3 2026)**
   - Extract microservices one domain at a time
   - Begin with less critical domains (reporting, notifications)
   - Progress to core domains (accounts, payments, customers)
   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout

4. **Database Decomposition (Ongoing)**
   - Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) where appropriate
   - Create service-specific databases for extracted services
   - Manage dual-write/dual-read patterns during transition
   - Implement eventual consistency patterns for cross-domain queries

5. **Completion and Optimization (Q4 2026)**
   - Decommission monolith components
   - Optimize service communication patterns
   - Fine-tune performance and scalability
   - Enhance developer experience and tools

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Strategy

### Service Implementation

Each microservice will be implemented with:

- Python FastAPI for service endpoints
- Event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- Clean Architecture implementation
- Independent CI/CD pipelines
- Service-specific databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB based on use case)

### Interservice Communication

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for queries and commands requiring immediate response
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka-based event streaming for cross-domain events
- **Service Discovery**: Consul for service registration and discovery
- **API Gateway**: Kong/Traefik for routing, authentication, and rate limiting

### Data Strategy

- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data store
- **Data Replication**: Read replicas for reporting and analytics
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write models for complex domains
- **Event Sourcing**: For core transactional domains requiring audit trails
- **Data Migration**: Incremental migration with dual-write patterns
