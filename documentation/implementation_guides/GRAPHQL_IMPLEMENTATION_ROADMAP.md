# 🚀 GraphQL Implementation Roadmap for API Integration

> **Status:** Planned | **Target Start:** Q2 2025 | **Owner:** Integration Interfaces Team

---

## 📖 Overview
This document outlines the roadmap for implementing GraphQL support in the CBS_PYTHON Integration Interfaces API module. The goal is to provide a flexible, efficient, and modern API layer that complements existing REST endpoints and supports advanced client requirements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable GraphQL endpoint alongside REST API for all core banking domains
- Support queries, mutations, and subscriptions for real-time updates
- Ensure security, validation, and performance best practices
- Provide comprehensive documentation and schema introspection
- Integrate with Clean Architecture and domain-driven design principles

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Phases

### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (May–June 2025)
- [ ] Evaluate GraphQL frameworks (Strawberry, Ariadne, Graphene, etc.)
- [ ] Define GraphQL schema for core banking domains (accounts, customers, transactions, loans)
- [ ] Design authentication and authorization strategy for GraphQL endpoints
- [ ] Plan integration with existing DI container and Clean Architecture layers

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Core Implementation (June–July 2025)
- [ ] Set up GraphQL server (FastAPI/Starlette integration)
- [ ] Implement schema, resolvers, and type definitions for:
  - Accounts
  - Customers
  - Transactions
  - Loans
- [ ] Add support for queries and mutations
- [ ] Integrate with application and domain layers (use cases, entities)
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation

### 3️⃣ Phase 3: Advanced Features (July–August 2025)
- [ ] Add subscriptions for real-time updates (e.g., transaction notifications)
- [ ] Implement batching and caching for performance
- [ ] Add field-level authorization and rate limiting
- [ ] Integrate with monitoring and logging systems

### 4️⃣ Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (August 2025)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all resolvers
- [ ] Generate and publish GraphQL schema documentation
- [ ] Provide usage examples and migration guides
- [ ] Conduct performance and security audits

### 5️⃣ Phase 5: Rollout & Feedback (September 2025)
- [ ] Deploy GraphQL endpoint to staging and production
- [ ] Gather feedback from internal and external consumers
- [ ] Iterate and improve based on feedback

---

## 🧩 Integration with Clean Architecture
- Resolvers will call application layer use cases, not domain or infrastructure directly
- Schema and type definitions will be kept separate from business logic
- Dependency injection will be used for repository and service access
- Error handling will follow existing Clean Architecture patterns
