# 🛠️ Microservices Migration Strategy for CBS_PYTHON

> **Status:** Planned | **Target Start:** Q3 2025 | **Owner:** Architecture Team

---

## 📖 Overview
This document outlines the strategy for migrating CBS_PYTHON from a modular monolith to a microservices-based architecture. The goal is to improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility while leveraging the Clean Architecture foundation already in place.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define clear service boundaries based on banking domains
- Enable independent deployment, scaling, and development of services
- Ensure robust inter-service communication and data consistency
- Maintain security, observability, and operational excellence
- Minimize disruption during migration

## 🗺️ Migration Phases

### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Assessment & Planning (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Identify microservice candidates (accounts, customers, payments, etc.)
- [ ] Define service boundaries and APIs
- [ ] Evaluate technology stack (FastAPI, gRPC, message queues, etc.)
- [ ] Plan data management and migration strategy
- [ ] Design service discovery and API gateway approach

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Infrastructure Preparation (Q3–Q4 2025)
- [ ] Set up containerization (Docker) for all modules
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines for microservices
- [ ] Establish centralized logging, monitoring, and tracing
- [ ] Prepare infrastructure as code (IaC) templates

### 3️⃣ Phase 3: Service Extraction & Refactoring (Q4 2025)
- [ ] Extract core modules as independent services (e.g., Accounts, UPI, Audit Trail)
- [ ] Refactor code to remove tight coupling and shared state
- [ ] Implement inter-service communication (REST/gRPC/events)
- [ ] Migrate data stores as needed (database-per-service or shared DB with schema separation)

### 4️⃣ Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Q4 2025–Q1 2026)
- [ ] Integrate services via API gateway and service mesh
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end and contract testing
- [ ] Implement fallback and resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries)
- [ ] Monitor performance and reliability

### 5️⃣ Phase 5: Rollout & Optimization (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Gradually migrate production traffic to microservices
- [ ] Monitor, optimize, and iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Document lessons learned and update operational runbooks

---

## 🧩 Clean Architecture Alignment
- Each microservice will retain Clean Architecture layers internally
- Domain logic and use cases remain isolated from infrastructure
- Service APIs will expose only application layer interfaces
- Dependency injection and event-driven patterns will be leveraged

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance
- Implement zero trust security at service boundaries
- Centralize secrets management and access control
- Ensure auditability and compliance for all services
