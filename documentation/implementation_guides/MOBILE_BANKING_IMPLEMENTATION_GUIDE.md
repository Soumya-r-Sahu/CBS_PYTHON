# 📱 Mobile Banking Module Implementation Guide

> **Status:** In Progress | **Target Completion:** June 2025 | **Owner:** Digital Channels Team

## 📖 Overview
This guide provides best practices and step-by-step instructions for implementing the Mobile Banking module in CBS_PYTHON using Clean Architecture and domain-driven design principles.

---

## 🧩 Clean Architecture Alignment
- **Domain Layer:** Define entities (MobileUser, Device, Session), value objects, and business rules for mobile banking.
- **Application Layer:** Implement use cases (login, view accounts, transfer funds, mobile payments, notifications).
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Develop repository implementations, push notification adapters, and device management integrations.
- **Presentation Layer:** Build REST API endpoints and mobile app interface (Flutter/React Native/Native).

## 🗺️ Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Domain Layer
- [ ] Define entities: MobileUser, Device, Session
- [ ] Create value objects: PhoneNumber, DeviceToken, OTP
- [ ] Implement domain services: MobileAuthService, DeviceManager
- [ ] Add domain events: DeviceRegistered, UserLoggedIn, SessionExpired

### 2️⃣ Application Layer
- [ ] Define repository interfaces: MobileUserRepository, DeviceRepository
- [ ] Implement use cases: Login, Logout, ViewAccounts, TransferFunds, RegisterDevice, ManageNotifications
- [ ] Add DTOs for requests and responses

### 3️⃣ Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] Implement repositories (SQLAlchemy, Redis for sessions)
- [ ] Integrate with push notification services (FCM/APNs)
- [ ] Add security features (device binding, biometric auth, rate limiting)

### 4️⃣ Presentation Layer
- [ ] Build REST API endpoints for all use cases
- [ ] Develop mobile app interface (MVP: login, dashboard, transfer, notifications)
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### 5️⃣ Testing & Security
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all layers
- [ ] Conduct security audits (OWASP Mobile Top 10)
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Enforce device registration and binding
- Use secure storage for credentials and tokens
- Implement biometric authentication where possible
- Log all critical actions for audit
