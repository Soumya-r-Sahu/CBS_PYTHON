# Risk Compliance Clean Architecture Progress

Last Updated: May 24, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of the Risk Compliance module to Clean Architecture. The Risk Compliance module is responsible for managing risk assessment, regulatory compliance, fraud detection, anti-money laundering (AML) processes, and ensuring regulatory reporting across the banking system.

## Current Challenges

1. Keeping pace with changing regulatory requirements
2. Integration with multiple external compliance systems
3. Balancing fraud detection accuracy with performance
4. Implementing cross-jurisdiction regulatory compliance
5. Developing scalable risk assessment models
6. Maintaining comprehensive audit trails for compliance verification

## Completed Milestones

- Implemented ComplianceRule domain entities with validation
- Created rule evaluation service with compliance checking
- Implemented risk assessment model framework
- Established clean architecture directory structure for risk compliance
- Developed compliance rule repository implementation

## Next Steps
1. Complete Risk Assessment System:
   - Implement risk calculation service
   - Develop remaining risk assessment use cases
   - Implement risk assessment repository

2. Implement Fraud Detection System:
   - Complete fraud alert entity implementation
   - Develop fraud detection use cases
   - Implement pattern recognition algorithms

3. Begin AML Processing Implementation:
   - Design AML case entities and workflow
   - Implement AML analysis service
   - Develop case management use cases

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Regulatory compliance gaps | Regular compliance reviews and automated checks | 🟡 Monitoring |
| False positives in fraud detection | Machine learning model refinement and tuning | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Excessive compliance overhead | Optimize rule processing with caching and efficient algorithms | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Inconsistent risk assessment | Standardize risk models and centralize calculation logic | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Audit trail inadequacies | Implement comprehensive event sourcing for compliance activities | 🔴 Not Addressed |
