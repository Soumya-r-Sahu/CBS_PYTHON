## 2. Modular Core Banking System in Python

### 🏗️ Modular Architecture Overview

The modular architecture for the Core Banking System is designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. It organizes the system into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility, as illustrated below:

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│     🎨 Presentation    │  CLI, Web UI, API endpoints
└───────────┬───────────┘
            │
┌───────────┼───────────┐
│  🛠️ Application Layer │  Use cases, services, orchestration
└───────────┬───────────┘
            │
┌───────────┼───────────┐
│   🧠 Domain Layer    │  Business logic, entities, rules
└───────────┬───────────┘
            │
┌───────────┼───────────┐
│ 🌐 Infrastructure Layer │  Database, external APIs, messaging
└───────────────────────┘
```

### 🌟 Key Principles of Modular Design

1. **🧹 Separation of Concerns**:
    - Each module focuses on a specific business capability (e.g., accounts, loans, payments).
    - Reduces interdependencies and improves code clarity.

2. **🔄 Independent Development**:
    - Modules can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
    - Enables parallel development and faster delivery.

3. **📜 Well-Defined Interfaces**:
    - Modules communicate through clearly defined APIs or interfaces.
    - Ensures consistent integration and reduces dependency issues.

4. **📦 Dependency Management**:
    - Modules declare their dependencies explicitly.
    - The system ensures that all required modules are active before execution.

5. **🔧 Extensibility**:
    - New modules can be added without modifying existing ones.
    - Supports evolving business requirements.

### 🚀 Benefits of Modular Architecture

- **📈 Scalability**: Easily add new features or modules.
- **🛠️ Maintainability**: Isolated modules simplify debugging and updates.
- **✅ Testability**: Modules can be tested independently.
- **🔒 Security**: Clear boundaries reduce the risk of unintended access.
- **⚡ Flexibility**: Adapts to changing business needs without disrupting the system.

By adopting this modular approach, the Core Banking System will become a robust, scalable, and future-proof platform, capable of meeting the dynamic demands of the banking industry.

### 🎯 Target Structure (Clean Architecture within Domains)

For each domain directory (e.g., `core_banking`, `digital_channels`), we will introduce the following layers:

```
domain_name/
├── domain/                # Domain Layer
│   ├── entities/          # Business entities and value objects 
│   ├── validators/        # Domain validation rules
│   └── services/          # Pure domain business logic
├── application/           # Application Layer
│   ├── use_cases/         # Application use cases
│   ├── services/          # Orchestration services
│   └── interfaces/        # Interfaces that infrastructure must implement
├── infrastructure/        # Infrastructure Layer
│   ├── repositories/      # Data access implementation
│   ├── apis/              # External API integration
│   └── adapters/          # Adapters for external services
└── presentation/          # Presentation Layer
    ├── api/               # API controllers/views
    ├── cli/               # CLI interfaces
    └── gui/               # GUI implementations
```

---

### 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

1. **Domain Layer**:
   - Should have no dependencies on other layers.
   - Use value objects for immutable concepts.
   - Define clear boundaries and invariants.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Should depend only on the domain layer.
   - Use interfaces for external dependencies.
   - Focus on orchestration, not business rules.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Implements interfaces defined in the application layer.
   - Handles external concerns like database, messaging, etc.
   - Should be replaceable without changing domain or application.

4. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Handles UI concerns (API, CLI, GUI).
   - Depends on the application layer for use cases.
   - Transforms domain objects to view models as needed.

### 🚀 Major Update: Directory and Naming Cleanup (May 16, 2025)

- All hyphenated directories have been renamed to use underscores (e.g., `digital-channels` → `digital_channels`).
- All Python files and directories now use underscores for compatibility and consistency.
- All references in documentation and code have been updated to match the new naming convention.
- All legacy hyphenated directories have been deleted from the repository.
