# Security Clean Architecture Progress

Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of the Security module to Clean Architecture. The Security module is responsible for implementing authentication, authorization, encryption, access control, and audit logging across the CBS_PYTHON system to ensure data protection and regulatory compliance.

## Module Components Status

| Component | Domain Layer | Application Layer | Infrastructure Layer | Presentation Layer | Overall |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Authentication | 🟢 Complete | 🟡 In Progress | 🟠 Partial | 🔴 Not Started | 🟡 In Progress |
| Authorization | 🟡 In Progress | 🟠 Partial | 🔴 Not Started | 🔴 Not Started | 🟠 Partial |
| Encryption | 🟢 Complete | 🟢 Complete | 🟡 In Progress | 🔴 Not Started | 🟡 In Progress |
| Audit | 🟡 In Progress | 🔴 Not Started | 🔴 Not Started | 🔴 Not Started | 🟠 Partial |
| Access Control | 🟠 Partial | 🔴 Not Started | 🔴 Not Started | 🔴 Not Started | 🟠 Partial |

Legend:
- 🟢 Complete: Implementation complete and tested
- 🟡 In Progress: Implementation ongoing
- 🟠 Partial: Partially implemented
- 🔴 Not Started: Not yet implemented

## Current Challenges

1. Integration with existing legacy authentication systems
2. Implementing fine-grained permission system across all modules
3. Ensuring consistent security policy enforcement throughout the system
4. Supporting multiple authentication factors while maintaining usability
5. Meeting regulatory compliance requirements for data protection
6. Implementing comprehensive security audit logging

## Completed Milestones

- Implemented User and Role domain entities with validation rules
- Created authentication service with password policy enforcement
- Implemented encryption service with industry-standard algorithms
- Completed user authentication flow with comprehensive logging
- Established clean architecture directory structure for security components

## Next Steps
1. Complete Authentication System:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication use cases
   - Complete session management infrastructure
   - Develop authentication presentation layer

2. Implement Authorization System:
   - Complete permission-based authorization service
   - Implement role management use cases
   - Develop authorization infrastructure components

3. Implement Audit System:
   - Complete audit logging service
   - Develop audit query and reporting use cases
   - Implement tamper-evident audit storage

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Authentication bypass vulnerabilities | Comprehensive penetration testing and code review | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Inadequate encryption key management | Implement HSM integration and key rotation policies | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Session fixation attacks | Implement session regeneration on authentication | 🟢 Addressed |
| Insufficient audit logging | Comprehensive audit strategy with tamper-evident storage | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Regulatory compliance gaps | Regular security assessments and compliance audits | 🟡 Monitoring |
