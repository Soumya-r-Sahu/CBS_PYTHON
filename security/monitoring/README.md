# Security Monitoring

This directory contains components for security monitoring and vulnerability scanning.

## Components

- `vulnerability_scanner.py` - System vulnerability scanner for identifying security issues

## Features

- Automated security scanning
- Vulnerability detection and reporting
- Security baseline enforcement
- Compliance checks

## Usage

```python
# Basic vulnerability scanning
from security.monitoring.vulnerability_scanner import VulnerabilityScanner

# Create scanner instance
scanner = VulnerabilityScanner()

# Run security scan
scan_results = scanner.scan_system()

# Process results
if scan_results["critical_vulnerabilities"]:
    for vuln in scan_results["critical_vulnerabilities"]:
        print(f"Critical vulnerability found: {vuln['name']} - {vuln['description']}")
        print(f"Remediation: {vuln['remediation']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. Schedule regular automated scans
2. Address critical vulnerabilities immediately
3. Track vulnerability metrics over time
4. Include both automated and manual security testing
5. Keep vulnerability definitions up to date
