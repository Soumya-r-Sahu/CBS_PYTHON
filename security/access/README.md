# Access Control Security

This directory contains components for controlling access to system resources.

## Components

- `access_control.py` - Role-based access control and permission management for banking resources

## Usage

```python
# Role-based access control
from security.access.access_control import check_permissions, get_user_roles

# Check if a user can perform an operation
if check_permissions(user_id, "account:transfer", account_id):
    # Execute transfer
    perform_transfer(account_id, destination_id, amount)
else:
    # Return access denied
    raise AccessDeniedException("Insufficient permissions")
```

## Best Practices

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Use role-based access control
3. Centralize access control logic
4. Log access control decisions for audit purposes
5. Regularly review access control settings
