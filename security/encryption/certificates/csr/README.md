# Security Certificates - Certificate Signing Requests

This directory is for storing Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).

## CSR Management

- Store CSRs here before they are signed by a Certificate Authority
- Document the details of each CSR (domain, organization, key size, etc.)
- Remove CSRs once the corresponding certificate has been received and verified
