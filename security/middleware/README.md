# Security middlewares

"""
This folder is for storing custom security middleware scripts.

How to Implement:
- Place Python modules here that implement authentication, authorization, or request validation.
- Import and use these middlewares in your main application (e.g., FastAPI, Flask).

Schema Example:
- Each middleware should define a class or function (e.g., AuthMiddleware) with a clear interface.

Sample Middleware Skeleton:
class AuthMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app
    def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
        # Implement authentication logic here
        return self.app(environ, start_response)
