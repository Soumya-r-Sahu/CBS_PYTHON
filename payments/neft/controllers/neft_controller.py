NEFT Controllers Module for Core Banking System

This module provides controller interfaces for National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) payments 
within the Core Banking System. It handles the business logic for NEFT transactions including
initiation, status checking, and batch processing.

The NEFT system follows the RBI guidelines for electronic funds transfer and provides a secure
and reliable mechanism for interbank transfers across India.

Features:
---------
1. NEFT transfer initiation with comprehensive validation
2. Transaction status tracking throughout the payment lifecycle
3. Batch processing for scheduled NEFT transfers
4. Exception handling with detailed error reporting
5. Audit logging of all operations

Transaction States:
------------------
- INITIATED: Transaction has been created but not yet submitted
- PENDING: Transaction has been submitted to NEFT system
- PROCESSING: Transaction is being processed by the receiving bank
- COMPLETED: Transaction has been successfully completed
- FAILED: Transaction processing failed
- RETURNED: Transaction was returned by the receiving bank

Service Hours:
-------------
NEFT operates in hourly batches from Monday to Friday (8:00 AM to 7:00 PM) 
and the first and third Saturdays of the month (8:00 AM to 1:00 PM).
Transactions submitted after cutoff time are processed in the next batch.

Usage Examples:
--------------
