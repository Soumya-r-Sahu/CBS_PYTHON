# Payments Clean Architecture Guide

Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document provides guidance for implementing and maintaining Clean Architecture in the Payments module of the CBS_PYTHON system. The Payments module handles various payment methods including NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, and UPI transactions, ensuring secure and efficient fund transfers.

## Module-Specific Architecture

  - UPIAdapter: Implementation for UPI payment processing
  - PaymentNotificationAdapter: Payment notification implementation
  - FraudDetectionAdapter: Fraud detection implementation
  - ComplianceAdapter: Regulatory compliance implementation

- **Database Models**:
  - PaymentModel: Database model for payments
  - PaymentGatewayModel: Database model for payment gateways
  - ReconciliationModel: Database model for payment reconciliation
  - PaymentScheduleModel: Database model for scheduled payments
  - PaymentStatusHistoryModel: Database model for payment status tracking
  - PaymentAuditModel: Database model for payment audit trail

### Presentation Layer Components

- **API Controllers**:
  - PaymentController: REST endpoints for payment processing
  - PaymentStatusController: REST endpoints for payment status queries
  - ReconciliationController: REST endpoints for reconciliation
  - PaymentScheduleController: REST endpoints for scheduled payments
  - PaymentGatewayController: REST endpoints for gateway management

- **DTOs**:
  - PaymentRequestDTO: Data transfer object for payment requests
  - PaymentResponseDTO: Data transfer object for payment responses
  - PaymentStatusDTO: Data transfer object for payment status
  - ReconciliationDTO: Data transfer object for reconciliation
  - PaymentScheduleDTO: Data transfer object for scheduled payments
  - PaymentErrorDTO: Data transfer object for payment errors

## Module-Specific Guidelines

### Domain Model Guidelines

- All payment entities must include proper validation for beneficiary details
- Payment method-specific validation rules must be encapsulated in domain services
- Payment status transitions must follow the defined state machine
- Implement proper validation for payment routing codes and account numbers
- All monetary values must use appropriate value objects to prevent calculation errors
- Implement payment idempotency to prevent duplicate payments

### Use Case Implementation

- All payment processing must include fraud detection checks
- Implement proper error handling with specific payment error codes
- Include comprehensive audit logging for all payment operations
- Batch processing should handle partial failures gracefully
- Payment reconciliation must include automated matching algorithms
- All payments must pass compliance checks before processing
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed payments with appropriate backoff

### Repository Implementation

- Use database transactions for all payment operations
- Implement optimistic concurrency control for payment status updates
- Store encrypted payment details for sensitive information
- Implement efficient querying for payment status tracking
- Include archiving strategy for completed payments
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Implement caching for frequently accessed payment gateway configurations

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for payment endpoints
- Implement idempotency keys for all payment requests
- Include proper authentication and authorization
- Provide detailed error responses with appropriate status codes
- Include webhooks for payment status notifications
- Support batch payment operations efficiently
- Document all API endpoints with examples

## Module-Specific Version Control

### Branching

- Feature branches should be named: `feature/payments-[feature-name]`
- Bug fixes should be named: `fix/payments-[issue-description]`

### Commit Messages

- Include the module prefix in commit messages: `[PAYMENTS] feat: add UPI payment processing`
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `[PAYMENTS] fix: resolve NEFT processing issue (#123)`
