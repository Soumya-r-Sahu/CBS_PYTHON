- Added daily fraud reporting capabilities
- Enhanced NPCI gateway service with better error handling
- Implemented transaction reconciliation with suspicious activity detection
- Extended UPI controller with endpoints for reconciliation and fraud analysis
- Updated documentation to reflect Clean Architecture implementation status

## Recent Updates (May 17, 2025)
- Completed the Infrastructure layer with reconciliation and fraud detection services
- Added support for transaction verification with NPCI gateway
- Implemented comprehensive fraud detection using rule-based analysis
- Fixed issues with dependency injection container
- Extended controller with new endpoints for reconciliation and fraud analysis
- Updated main_clean_architecture.py to initialize all services

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed undefined variables in main.py
   - Added missing controller imports
   - Implemented proper UpiConfig initialization
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Ongoing Work
1. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Implementing repository classes with proper ORM models
   - Creating service adapters for external dependencies
   - Setting up database access with proper serialization/deserialization

2. **Presentation Layer**
   - Finalizing REST API controllers
   - Implementing CLI interface for UPI operations
   - Creating admin dashboard integration

## Next Steps
1. Complete SqlUpiTransactionRepository implementation
2. Finalize notification service implementations
3. Complete API controllers and CLI interface
4. Implement comprehensive error handling
5. Add integration with monitoring systems
6. Develop comprehensive test suite

## Dependencies
- Core Banking - Accounts module
- Integration Interfaces - API module
- Security module for authentication

## Architecture Details
The UPI module follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:
- Domain entities represent the core business objects
- Application layer orchestrates use cases
- Infrastructure layer provides concrete implementations
- Presentation layer handles user interaction

## Additional Notes
- The module integration with the NPCI gateway uses mock implementations for testing
- Security considerations have been addressed in the domain and application layers
- Performance optimization will be addressed after functional completion
