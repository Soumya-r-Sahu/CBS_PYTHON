# Core Banking System - Payments Domain

This directory contains implementations of various payment systems following Clean Architecture principles.

## Overview

The Payments module is a core component of the CBS_PYTHON banking system, responsible for processing and managing all payment transactions across multiple channels and payment methods. It provides a robust, secure, and extensible framework for handling various payment types including bank transfers, card payments, mobile payments, and cash transactions.

## Module Structure

Each payment module follows Clean Architecture principles with the following layered structure:

## Clean Architecture Principles Applied

- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward, with the domain layer at the center having no external dependencies
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are defined in the application layer and implemented in the infrastructure layer
- **Dependency Injection**: External dependencies are injected through constructors
- **Pure Domain Model**: Domain entities contain behavior and business rules, not just data
- **Use Case Driven**: Application functionality is organized around use cases
- **Testing First**: Architecture designed to be testable at all layers independently
- **Framework Independence**: Core business logic is independent of frameworks and external libraries

## Clean Architecture Checklist for Payments Domain

- [x] README explains module architecture
- [x] Clean Architecture layers are clearly documented
- [x] Domain model is documented (entities, relationships, business rules)
- [x] Public interfaces are documented
- [x] Complex business rules have comments explaining the "why"
- [x] Interface methods have docstrings explaining the contract
- [x] Domain entities have docstrings explaining the business concepts
- [x] Use cases have docstrings explaining the business workflow

See the main [Clean Architecture Validation Checklist](../documentation/implementation_guides/CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_CHECKLIST.md) for full details and validation steps.

## Documentation Guidance
- Document the domain model in `domain/` (entities, value objects, business rules)
- Document interfaces in `application/interfaces/`
- Document use cases in `application/use_cases/`
- Document infrastructure implementations in `infrastructure/`
- Document presentation logic in `presentation/`

## Red Flags
- Domain layer importing from infrastructure layer
- Business logic in repositories
- Direct database access in controllers
- Anemic domain model (no business logic in entities)
- Fat repositories (business logic in repositories)
- Missing interfaces for infrastructure
- No dependency injection
- Business rules spread across layers
- UI logic mixed with business logic
- Direct use of third-party libraries in domain/application
