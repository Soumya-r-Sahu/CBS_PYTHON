# Payments Clean Architecture Progress

Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of the Payments module to Clean Architecture. The Payments module is responsible for managing various payment methods including NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, and UPI transactions, ensuring secure and efficient fund transfers across the banking system.

## Current Challenges

1. Integration with multiple external payment gateways
2. Handling payment idempotency across distributed systems
3. Implementing payment status tracking with real-time updates
4. Ensuring compliance with current regulatory requirements
5. Optimizing performance for high-volume UPI transactions

## Completed Milestones

- Implemented UPI domain entities with validation rules
- Created payment processing use cases for UPI transactions
- Established clean architecture directory structure for all payment methods
- Completed UPI controller implementation for basic operations
- Implemented payment status value objects with state transitions

## Next Steps
1. Complete NEFT Domain Layer:
   - Implement payment status state machine
   - Complete validation rules for all payment types
   - Finalize repository interface contracts

2. Implement UPI Application Layer:
   - Complete remaining use cases
   - Integrate with fraud detection service
   - Implement payment notification system

3. Develop RTGS Infrastructure Layer:
   - Implement repository implementations
   - Create adapter for RTGS gateway
   - Build transaction logging mechanism

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Payment timeout inconsistencies | Implement consistent timeout handling across all payment methods | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Regulatory compliance changes | Regular review of payment regulations and compliance updates | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Gateway integration failures | Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Duplicate payment processing | Enforce idempotency keys across all payment endpoints | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Performance bottlenecks | Load testing and performance optimization for high-volume scenarios | 🟡 Monitoring |
