# CHANGELOG

## [2025-05-17] - Clean Architecture Implementation

### Added
- Implemented Clean Architecture pattern for RTGS module:
  - Created domain entities:
    - rtgs_transaction.py: RTGS transaction entity with business rules
    - rtgs_batch.py: RTGS batch entity for grouped transactions
  
  - Created domain services:
    - rtgs_validation_service.py: Business rules for validating RTGS transactions
    - rtgs_batch_service.py: Business logic for batch operations and scheduling
  
  - Created application interfaces:
    - rtgs_transaction_repository_interface.py: Interface for transaction repositories
    - rtgs_batch_repository_interface.py: Interface for batch repositories
    - rtgs_notification_service_interface.py: Interface for notification services
    - rtgs_rbi_interface_service_interface.py: Interface for RBI integration
    - rtgs_audit_log_service_interface.py: Interface for audit logging
  
  - Created application use cases:
    - transaction_creation_use_case.py: Logic for creating new transactions
    - transaction_processing_use_case.py: Logic for processing transactions
    - transaction_query_use_case.py: Logic for querying transactions
    - batch_processing_use_case.py: Logic for processing batches
    - batch_query_use_case.py: Logic for querying batches
  
  - Created infrastructure implementations:
    - SQLRTGSTransactionRepository: SQL implementation of transaction repository
    - SQLRTGSBatchRepository: SQL implementation of batch repository
    - RTGSRBIInterfaceService: Implementation of RBI interface
    - SMSNotificationService: Implementation of notification service
    - SQLAuditLogService: Implementation of audit logging
  
  - Created presentation layer:
    - rtgs_controller.py: REST API endpoints for RTGS operations
    - rtgs_cli.py: Command Line Interface for RTGS operations
  
  - Created dependency injection container:
    - di_container.py: Manages dependencies and their lifecycles
  
  - Created main application entry point:
    - main_clean_architecture.py: Flask application for RTGS module

### Changed
- Moved from legacy architecture to Clean Architecture pattern
- Improved separation of concerns with distinct layers
- Enhanced testability with dependency injection
- Strengthened domain logic encapsulation
- Better maintainability with clear boundaries between modules

### Implemented Best Practices
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- SOLID principles adherence
- Dependency Injection for better testability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Interface segregation
- Explicit dependencies
- Clean domain models

### Benefits
- Enhanced modularity and maintainability
- Easier to test each component in isolation
- Domain logic is protected from external changes
- Framework independence (core business logic doesn't depend on Flask)
- Better adaptability to changing requirements
- Clearer architecture for new developers to understand
