# Cross-Cutting Concerns in Clean Architecture

## Overview

Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a system that affect multiple layers and components. In a Clean Architecture implementation, these concerns need to be managed in a way that doesn't violate the dependency rule (inner layers should not depend on outer layers).

This document explains the cross-cutting concerns implementation for the CBS_PYTHON banking system.

## Implemented Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 1. Error Handling

The error handling framework provides:

- **Business Exceptions**: A hierarchy of exception classes for business rule violations
- **Standard Error Codes**: Consistent error codes used throughout the system
- **Exception Handling Decorator**: A decorator for standardizing exception handling in use cases

### 2. Logging

The logging system provides:

- **Centralized Logger Configuration**: Consistent logging across all modules
- **Method Call Logging**: A decorator for logging method calls, parameters, and results
- **Contextual Logging**: Rich context information captured with log entries

### 3. Domain Events (In Progress)

The domain events infrastructure will provide:

- **Event Definition**: Standard structure for domain events
- **Event Publishing**: Mechanism for publishing events from domain entities
- **Event Handlers**: Framework for subscribing to and handling events

## Usage Examples

### Error Handling

```python
from utils.cross_cutting import BusinessException, ValidationException, ErrorCodes

# In a domain service or entity
def withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount > self.balance:
        raise BusinessException(
            message="Insufficient funds for withdrawal",
            error_code=ErrorCodes.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS,
            details={"available": self.balance, "requested": amount}
        )
    
    # Process withdrawal...

# In a use case
def validate_request(self, request):
    errors = {}
    
    if not request.account_number:
        errors["account_number"] = "Account number is required"
    
    if request.amount <= 0:
        errors["amount"] = "Amount must be greater than zero"
    
    if errors:
        raise ValidationException("Validation failed", errors)
```

### Logging

```python
from utils.cross_cutting import log_method_call, logger

class AccountService:
    @log_method_call(logger)
    def transfer_funds(self, from_account, to_account, amount):
        # Method implementation...
        logger.info(f"Transferring {amount} from {from_account} to {to_account}")
        # More implementation...
```

### Exception Handling in Use Cases

```python
from utils.cross_cutting import handle_exceptions, logger

class TransferFundsUseCase:
    @handle_exceptions()
    def execute(self, request):
        # Use case implementation...
        return {"success": True, "data": result}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Domain Layer Clean**: The domain layer should throw domain-specific exceptions but not depend on the cross-cutting concerns framework directly.

2. **Handle Exceptions at Boundaries**: Catch and transform exceptions at architectural boundaries (e.g., API controllers, command handlers).

3. **Be Consistent**: Use standard error codes and logging patterns consistently across modules.

4. **Provide Context**: Include relevant context in exceptions and log messages to aid troubleshooting.

5. **Separate Technical vs. Business Errors**: Distinguish between technical failures and business rule violations.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metrics Collection**: Add performance metrics gathering
2. **Distributed Tracing**: Implement request tracing across service boundaries
3. **Audit Logging**: Specialized logging for compliance and security auditing
4. **Health Checks**: System health monitoring
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against overuse of resources
