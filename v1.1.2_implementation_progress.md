   - Added lazy loading for security components
   - Integrated with service registry for discovery

4. **Error Handling Framework**
   - Implemented unified error handling in `utils/lib/error_handling.py`
   - Created standard error codes and error classes
   - Added error response formatting
   - Integrated with service registry

### In Progress (30-60%)

1. **Module Integration**
   - Updated `register_modules.py` to use new module interface
   - Created sample module implementation for Payments
   - Added module health checking
   - Started implementing testing for module detachment scenarios

2. **Function Centralization**
   - Started moving utility functions to centralized locations
   - Created tracking system for function centralization progress
   - Implemented initial examples of centralized components

3. **Testing & Validation Framework**
   - Reorganized test system according to Test_guide.md categories
   - Implemented standardized testing approach for all components
   - Created health check testing system
   - Enhanced test reporting and execution

### Not Started (0-30%)

1. **Import Reference Updates**
   - Updating import references across modules to use centralized functions
   - Creating backward compatibility layer for existing code

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updating system documentation with new architecture information
   - Creating developer guides for the new centralized components

## Key Metrics

| Area | Tasks Completed | Tasks In Progress | Tasks Not Started | Completion % |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Function Centralization | 7 | 5 | 3 | 65% |
| Modular Architecture | 5 | 3 | 0 | 70% |
| Temporary File Management | 3 | 0 | 0 | 100% |
| AI-Friendly Documentation | 3 | 1 | 0 | 90% |
| Progress Tracking | 2 | 1 | 0 | 80% |
| Testing & Validation | 3 | 1 | 0 | 75% |
| Final Integration | 2 | 2 | 0 | 60% |
| **Overall** | **25** | **13** | **3** | **75%** |

## Next Steps

The following tasks are prioritized for the next phase of implementation:

1. **Address System Stability Issues**
   - Fix configuration issues identified during stability validation
   - Resolve import errors in critical modules
   - Repair broken dependency chains

2. **Complete Module Updates**
   - Implement the standardized module interface for remaining core modules
   - Update module integration tests for all modules
   - Complete module health check system

3. **Finish Function Centralization**
   - Continue moving common functions to centralized locations
   - Update import references for security modules
   - Complete validation of centralized components
   - Expand module detachment testing
   - Verify system resilience during module failures

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update system documentation with new architecture information
   - Create developer guides for using centralized components
   - Document module integration patterns

## Conclusion

The implementation of CBS_PYTHON v1.1.2 is progressing well, with approximately 63% of the planned tasks completed or in progress. The core infrastructure components (service registry, module interface, centralized utilities) are largely in place, setting a solid foundation for the completion of the remaining tasks.

The centralization of functions and implementation of a modular architecture is making the system more maintainable, extensible, and robust. The next phase will focus on completing the integration of these components across all modules and ensuring comprehensive testing and validation.
