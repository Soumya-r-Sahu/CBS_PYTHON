## Current Challenges

1. Ensuring consistent user experience across multiple channels
2. Implementing secure device registration and verification
3. Managing offline-to-online synchronization for mobile banking
4. Optimizing performance for low-bandwidth connections
5. Implementing consistent notification delivery across channels
6. Managing feature parity across different platforms

- Created authentication service with session management
- Implemented device registration for mobile banking
- Completed notification service design
- Established clean architecture directory structure for digital channels

## Next Steps
1. Complete Banking Web Implementation:
   - Finish remaining use cases
   - Complete repository implementations
   - Develop remaining controllers

2. Complete Mobile Banking Domain Layer:
   - Implement notification service
   - Complete session management
   - Finalize device verification service

3. Implement Common Services:
   - Complete notification delivery system
   - Implement menu service with role-based access
   - Develop channel activity tracking

## Risks and Mitigations
