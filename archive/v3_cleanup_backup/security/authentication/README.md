# Authentication Security

This directory contains components for user authentication, session management, and credential handling.

## Components

- `auth.py` - Core authentication functionality including JWT token management
- `password_manager.py` - Password policy enforcement, hashing, and validation
- `mfa.py` - Multi-factor authentication with TOTP and backup codes
- `session_manager.py` - Session handling, management, and timeout enforcement

## Usage

```python
# Authentication example
from security.authentication.auth import authenticate_user, create_jwt_token

# Multi-factor authentication
from security.authentication.mfa import verify_mfa, generate_totp_secret

# Password management
from security.authentication.password_manager import hash_password, validate_password

# Session management
from security.authentication.session_manager import create_session, validate_session
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use HTTPS for authentication requests
2. Store password hashes, never plaintext passwords
3. Implement proper account lockout policies
4. Use MFA for sensitive operations
5. Keep session lifetimes as short as practical
