# Requirements and Import System Sanitization Report

**Date:** May 18, 2025

## Summary

This report summarizes the changes made to sanitize duplicate requirement files and clean up import statements in the CBS_PYTHON project. The project had multiple requirements files and inconsistent import patterns, which made dependency management difficult and imports error-prone.

## Changes Made

### 1. Requirements Files Consolidated

- Created a single consolidated requirements.txt file at the project root
- Used version specifiers with '>=' to allow for compatible upgrades
- Organized dependencies by logical categories (Core, Database, Web Framework, etc.)
- Added comments to explain the purpose of optional dependencies
- Redirected legacy requirement files to the main requirements.txt:
  - database/requirements.txt
  - app/Portals/Admin/requirements.txt

### 2. Import System Cleanup

- Fixed duplicate database connection fallbacks in:
  - digital_channels/atm_switch/cash_withdrawal.py
  - digital_channels/atm_switch/pin_change.py
- Standardized imports to use the centralized import system (utils.lib.packages)
- Removed redundant environment function definitions
- Created tools for checking and fixing import issues:
  - scripts/import_checker.py
  - scripts/import_fixer.py

### 3. Documentation Added

- Created comprehensive import system guide:
  - documentation/technical_standards/import_system_guide.md
- Created requirements management documentation:
  - documentation/technical_standards/requirements_management.md
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to document changes

## Benefits

- **Simplified Dependency Management**: All dependencies are now managed in a single file
- **Consistent Import Patterns**: Standardized approach to importing modules
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate fallback implementations
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clearer documentation and tools for ongoing maintenance
- **Better Package Compatibility**: Version specifiers allow for compatible upgrades

## Follow-up Actions

For future maintenance, consider:

1. **Run Import Checker Regularly**: Integrate the import checker into CI/CD pipelines
2. **Package Version Updates**: Periodically check for new versions of dependencies
3. **Import System Education**: Ensure new team members understand the import system
4. **Dependency Pruning**: Regularly review and remove unused dependencies

## Technical Debt Addressed

This refactoring has addressed several areas of technical debt:
- Multiple competing requirements files
- Inconsistent import patterns
- Duplicate fallback implementations
- Lack of documentation on import standards

## Conclusion

The project's dependency management and import system have been significantly improved, making the codebase more maintainable and less prone to import-related errors.
