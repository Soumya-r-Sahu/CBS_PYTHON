## Current Challenges

1. Integration with external market data providers
2. Implementation of complex financial calculation models
3. Ensuring regulatory compliance for treasury operations
4. Real-time liquidity monitoring across multiple systems
5. Optimization of risk assessment algorithms for performance
6. Handling multi-currency operations consistently

## Completed Milestones

- Created bond portfolio management use cases
- Established clean architecture directory structure for treasury components
- Implemented liquidity position monitoring framework
- Created foreign exchange rate conversion functionality

## Next Steps
1. Complete Liquidity Management System:
   - Finish liquidity management service implementation
   - Develop liquidity forecasting use cases
   - Implement liquidity monitoring infrastructure

2. Complete Bond Module:
   - Finish remaining bond use cases
   - Implement market data integration
   - Develop bond portfolio presentation layer

3. Implement Forex Trading System:
   - Complete forex domain entities
   - Develop forex trading use cases
   - Implement exchange rate data infrastructure
