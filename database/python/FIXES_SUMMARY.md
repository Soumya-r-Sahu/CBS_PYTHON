# Database Model Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed Missing Function Calls**:
   - Changed all instances of `datetime.datetime.utcnow` to `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` to ensure the function is properly called
   - This prevents the "time.utcnow)" error and ensures proper timestamp generation

2. **Fixed Indentation Issues**:
   - Corrected indentation for `customer_id` in the Customer class
   - Corrected indentation for `account_number` in the Account class
   - Added proper spacing after class declarations

3. **Fixed Improper Spacing**:
   - Fixed the spacing issue in the Transaction class where `amount` column definition was improperly concatenated with the `channel` column

4. **Consistent Code Formatting**:
   - Ensured consistent spacing throughout the models.py file
   - Added proper line breaks between class attributes and relationships

## Summary of Changes

- Fixed all datetime functions by adding parentheses to function calls
- Fixed indentation throughout the file to ensure proper Python code structure
- Fixed column definitions to ensure proper spacing and line breaks
- Created a backup of the original file before replacing it

## Additional Notes

- The new file compiles without any syntax errors
- All models maintain their original functionality but with corrected syntax
- No changes were made to the actual database schema or model relationships
- The code now adheres to proper Python formatting standards
