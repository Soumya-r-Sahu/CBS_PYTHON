# CRM Clean Architecture Guide

Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document provides guidance for implementing and maintaining Clean Architecture in the CRM module of the CBS_PYTHON system. The CRM module is responsible for managing customer relationships, campaigns, leads, and providing a comprehensive 360-degree view of customers.

## Module-Specific Architecture

### Domain Layer Components

- **Entities**:
  - Customer: Core customer information model with business rules
  - Campaign: Campaign entity with targeting rules and execution logic
  - Lead: Potential customer information with qualification rules
  - Interaction: Customer touchpoint and communication records
  - Opportunity: Sales opportunity with conversion workflow

- **Value Objects**:
  - CustomerSegment: Immutable classification of customer groups
  - LeadScore: Immutable value representing lead quality
  - CampaignStatus: Immutable representation of campaign state
  - CustomerPreference: Immutable customer preference data
  - InteractionType: Categorization of customer interactions

- **Domain Services**:
  - LeadQualificationService: Business logic for qualifying leads
  - CustomerSegmentationService: Logic for customer segmentation
  - CampaignEligibilityService: Determines customer eligibility for campaigns

- **Repository Interfaces**:
  - ICustomerRepository: Interface for customer data access
  - ICampaignRepository: Interface for campaign data access
  - ILeadRepository: Interface for lead data access
  - IOpportunityRepository: Interface for opportunity data access
  - IInteractionRepository: Interface for customer interaction data access

### Application Layer Components

- **Use Cases**:
  - CreateCustomerUseCase: Register new customers in the system
  - UpdateCustomerProfileUseCase: Modify customer information
  - LaunchCampaignUseCase: Create and activate new marketing campaigns
  - QualifyLeadUseCase: Process and qualify new leads
  - TrackCustomerInteractionUseCase: Record customer touchpoints
  - GenerateCustomer360ViewUseCase: Create comprehensive customer view
  - ConvertLeadToOpportunityUseCase: Transform qualified leads to opportunities

- **Service Interfaces**:
  - INotificationService: Interface for sending notifications
  - IAnalyticsService: Interface for analytical operations
  - IReportingService: Interface for generating reports
  - ICoreIntegrationService: Interface for core banking integration
  - ICampaignOrchestrationService: Interface for campaign execution

### Infrastructure Layer Components

- **Repositories**:
  - CustomerRepository: Implementation of ICustomerRepository
  - CampaignRepository: Implementation of ICampaignRepository
  - LeadRepository: Implementation of ILeadRepository
  - OpportunityRepository: Implementation of IOpportunityRepository
  - InteractionRepository: Implementation of IInteractionRepository

- **External Service Adapters**:
  - EmailNotificationAdapter: Email notification implementation
  - SMSNotificationAdapter: SMS notification implementation
  - CoreBankingAdapter: Core banking integration implementation
  - AnalyticsAdapter: Analytics service implementation

- **Database Models**:
  - CustomerModel: Database model for customers
  - CampaignModel: Database model for campaigns
  - LeadModel: Database model for leads
  - OpportunityModel: Database model for opportunities
  - InteractionModel: Database model for customer interactions
  - Customer360ViewModel: Aggregated customer view model

### Presentation Layer Components

- **API Controllers**:
  - CustomerController: REST endpoints for customer operations
  - CampaignController: REST endpoints for campaign operations
  - LeadController: REST endpoints for lead operations
  - OpportunityController: REST endpoints for opportunity operations
  - Customer360Controller: REST endpoints for customer 360 view

- **DTOs**:
  - CustomerDTO: Data transfer object for customer operations
  - CampaignDTO: Data transfer object for campaign operations
  - LeadDTO: Data transfer object for lead operations
  - OpportunityDTO: Data transfer object for opportunity operations
  - Customer360ViewDTO: Data transfer object for customer comprehensive view
  - InteractionDTO: Data transfer object for customer interactions

## Module-Specific Guidelines

### Domain Model Guidelines

- Customer entity must include KYC verification status and validation
- Lead status transitions must follow the defined state machine
- Campaign targeting must validate against customer segmentation rules
- All customer interactions must be recorded with proper categorization
- Customer 360 view must integrate with core banking for financial data

### Use Case Implementation

- All customer modification use cases must include audit logging
- Campaign execution use cases must check for compliance constraints
- Lead qualification must follow the standardized scoring algorithm
- All external system interactions must use appropriate adapter interfaces
- Customer 360 view must optimize for query performance with caching

### Repository Implementation

- Use optimized queries for customer 360 view data aggregation
- Implement proper transaction management for campaign operations
- Cache frequently accessed customer segment data
- Use batch processing for campaign targeting operations
- Implement data consistency checks for customer profile updates

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for all CRM endpoints
- Implement proper pagination for customer and lead listings
- Include filtering capabilities on all list endpoints
- Secure all endpoints with proper authentication and authorization
- Provide consistent error handling and validation

## Module-Specific Version Control

### Branching

- Feature branches should be named: `feature/crm-[feature-name]`
- Bug fixes should be named: `fix/crm-[issue-description]`

### Commit Messages

- Include the module prefix in commit messages: `[CRM] feat: add lead scoring algorithm`
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `[CRM] fix: resolve campaign targeting issue (#123)`
