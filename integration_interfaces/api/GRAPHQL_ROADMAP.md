# GraphQL Implementation Roadmap

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Planning-blue) ![Priority](https://img.shields.io/badge/Priority-High-red) ![Timeline](https://img.shields.io/badge/Timeline-2025Q2--Q3-orange)

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for GraphQL support in the API Integration module of the CBS_PYTHON banking system. GraphQL will provide a more flexible and efficient API query interface alongside our existing REST API endpoints.

## üéØ Objectives

- Implement a GraphQL API layer following Clean Architecture principles
- Provide a single endpoint with comprehensive query capabilities
- Reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data
- Support complex nested queries across banking domains
- Maintain consistent security and performance standards

- [ ] Canary deployment process
- [ ] Developer documentation completion

## üîç Technical Specifications

### Schema Design Principles

- Use domain-driven naming conventions
- Implement interface types for shared behaviors
- Utilize union types for polymorphic responses
- Apply nullable fields only when semantically appropriate
- Include descriptions for all schema elements

### Example Schema (Core Banking Domain)

```graphql
type Account {
  id: ID!
  accountNumber: String!
  customerId: ID!
  customer: Customer!
  accountType: AccountType!
  balance: Money!
  status: AccountStatus!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  lastActivityAt: DateTime
  transactions(first: Int, after: String): TransactionConnection!
}

type Customer {
  id: ID!
  customerNumber: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String
  phone: String
  kycStatus: KYCStatus!
  accounts: [Account!]!
  address: Address
}

type TransactionConnection {
  edges: [TransactionEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  totalCount: Int!
}

type TransactionEdge {
  node: Transaction!
  cursor: String!
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}

enum AccountType {
  SAVINGS
  CURRENT
  LOAN
  TERM_DEPOSIT
}

enum AccountStatus {
  ACTIVE
  DORMANT
  CLOSED
  FROZEN
}

enum KYCStatus {
  PENDING
  VERIFIED
  REJECTED
  EXPIRED
}

scalar Money
scalar DateTime
```

## üîê Security Considerations

- Implement depth limiting to prevent recursive query attacks
- Add query complexity analysis to prevent resource exhaustion
- Utilize persisted queries for production clients
- Implement proper authentication and authorization at resolver level
- Apply rate limiting specific to GraphQL operations
- Hide implementation details in error messages

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- Implement DataLoader pattern to batch database requests
- Utilize caching for frequently accessed data
- Apply query cost analysis to prevent expensive operations
- Optimize resolver implementations for common query patterns
- Implement query whitelisting for production environments
- Use APM tools to identify bottlenecks

## üìù Documentation Strategy

- Generate schema documentation with GraphiQL/GraphQL Playground
- Create example queries for common operations
- Document best practices for clients
- Provide mutation examples with expected responses
- Include error handling documentation
- Create tutorials for complex query patterns

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all resolvers
- Integration tests for complex queries
- Performance benchmark tests
- Security penetration tests
- Schema validation tests
- Subscription reliability tests

## üìà Success Metrics

- API response time improvement compared to REST
- Reduction in total API calls for complex operations
- Developer satisfaction with API flexibility
- Client application performance improvement
- Reduced bandwidth usage for mobile applications
- Improved API documentation comprehensiveness

## üë• Team Allocation

- 2 Backend Developers (GraphQL schema and resolvers)
- 1 Domain Expert (Banking domain modeling)
- 1 Security Specialist (Authentication and authorization)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (Infrastructure and monitoring)
- 1 QA Engineer (Testing and quality assurance)

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Systems

- GraphQL will complement, not replace, existing REST APIs
- Authentication will use the same OAuth mechanisms
- Authorization policies will be consistent across API types
- Existing monitoring systems will be extended for GraphQL
