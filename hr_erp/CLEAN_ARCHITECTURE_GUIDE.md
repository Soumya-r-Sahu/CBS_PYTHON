## Module-Specific Guidelines

### Domain Model Guidelines

- **Validate at Boundaries**: Perform comprehensive validation at application service boundaries.
- **Apply Transactional Boundaries**: Ensure atomic operations for critical HR processes.
- **Enforce Idempotency**: Ensure duplicate submissions don't result in duplicate operations.
- **Apply Event-Driven Design**: Use domain events to coordinate cross-functional processes like employee onboarding.

- **Support Bulk Operations**: Enable batch processing for efficiency.
- **Versioning Strategy**: Implement API versioning to support evolving HR requirements.

## Module-Specific Version Control

### Branching

- Feature branches should be named: `feature/hr-erp-[feature-name]`
- Bug fixes should be named: `fix/hr-erp-[issue-description]`
- Module components should use: `feature/hr-erp-[component]-[feature-name]`, e.g. `feature/hr-erp-employee-biometric-integration`

### Commit Messages

- Include the module prefix in commit messages: `hr-erp: add employee biometric verification`
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `hr-erp: fix leave calculation bug (#235)`
- Use component prefixes: `hr-erp(leave): implement approval workflow logic`

### Review Process

1. **Initial Review**: Team lead reviews code against HR domain best practices
2. **Privacy Compliance**: Privacy officer reviews employee data handling code
3. **Security Review**: Security team reviews authentication and authorization controls
4. **Performance Check**: Performance testing for batch operations like payroll processing
5. **Integration Verification**: Test with connected systems (accounting, biometric, etc.)

## Testing Requirements

- **Privacy Testing**: Ensure all PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is properly secured and anonymized in test environments
- **Workflow Testing**: Comprehensive testing of multi-step approval workflows
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Verify data consistency across HR subsystems

- **Role-Based Testing**: Verify proper access controls across different organizational roles
- **Stress Testing**: Test system performance during high-volume HR operations (annual reviews, bonus calculations)
- **Compliance Testing**: Verify regulatory compliance for payroll, taxation, and employment law

## Dependency Management

- **HR Compliance Libraries**: Use approved libraries for tax calculation and regulatory compliance
- **Secure Document Storage**: Use enterprise document management systems with proper encryption
- **Encryption Requirements**: All PII must use approved encryption libraries
- **Analytics Integration**: Use approved data warehouse connectors for HR analytics
