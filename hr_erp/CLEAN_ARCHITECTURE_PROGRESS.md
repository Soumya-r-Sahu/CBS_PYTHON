# HR-ERP Clean Architecture Progress

Last Updated: May 24, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of the Human Resources and Enterprise Resource Planning (HR-ERP) module to Clean Architecture. The implementation follows domain-driven design principles to ensure that the system accurately reflects HR business processes, maintains data privacy, and provides a flexible foundation for evolving regulatory requirements.

## Current Challenges

1. **Data Migration Complexity**: Moving legacy employee data to the new domain model while maintaining historical integrity
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adapting domain models to support varying international labor regulations
3. **Integration Complexity**: Coordinating with multiple external systems (payroll, biometrics, learning management)
4. **Performance at Scale**: Ensuring system performance for large-scale operations like company-wide performance reviews
5. **Privacy Requirements**: Implementing proper data protection measures for sensitive employee information

## Completed Milestones

- âœ… Domain model core entities defined for key HR-ERP components
- âœ… Repository interfaces established for main components
- âœ… Clean architecture patterns documented and socialized with development team
- âœ… Value objects implemented for Employee and organizational structure
- âœ… Initial application services defined for employee management

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Employee Management Implementation**:
   - Finalize Employee domain model with all relevant attributes and relationships
   - Implement repository patterns for employee data persistence
   - Create application services for employee lifecycle management
   - Develop API controllers for employee operations

2. **Implement Leave Management System**:
   - Finalize leave request workflow with multi-level approvals
   - Develop leave balance calculation service with policy enforcement
   - Create infrastructure components for leave tracking
   - Implement notification system for leave status updates

3. **Develop Performance Management Framework**:
   - Build performance review domain models with customizable evaluation criteria
   - Implement goal-setting and tracking functionality
   - Create reporting capabilities for performance analytics
   - Develop 360-degree feedback collection mechanisms

4. **Create Sample Implementation Showcasing Clean Architecture**:
   - Develop employee onboarding process as a reference implementation
   - Document the implementation following clean architecture patterns
   - Create comprehensive tests demonstrating layers separation
   - Provide example usage for other module developers
