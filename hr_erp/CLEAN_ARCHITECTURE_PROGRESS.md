## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing the Leave Management module:
   - Complete the domain layer entities, value objects, and interfaces
   - Implement application layer use cases for leave application and approval
   - Create infrastructure layer repositories for leave data
   - Build presentation layer controllers and interfaces

2. Start implementing the Performance Management module:
   - Design and implement domain layer with performance review entities
   - Create application layer use cases for performance management workflows
   - Implement infrastructure layer for persistence
   - Build presentation layer interfaces

3. Enhance test coverage:
   - Add unit tests for domain entities and business rules
   - Create integration tests for repositories
   - Implement end-to-end tests for API controllers

4. Improve documentation:
   - Add detailed API documentation for controllers
   - Update architecture diagrams to reflect implementation
   - Create usage examples for each module
