# Infrastructure Layer Implementation

This document provides an overview of the Infrastructure Layer implementation in the CBS_PYTHON banking system following Clean Architecture principles.

## Overview

The Infrastructure Layer is the outermost layer in Clean Architecture that deals with external concerns such as databases, file systems, external APIs, and other technical details. This layer implements interfaces defined in the Application Layer, ensuring that the core business logic doesn't depend on specific implementation details.

## Key Components

### 1. Repositories

Repositories implement interfaces defined in the Application Layer and handle all data access operations:

- **SQL Repositories**: Implement data access using SQL databases
  - `SqlCustomerRepository`: Implements the `CustomerRepositoryInterface`
  - `SqlAccountRepository`: Implements the `AccountRepositoryInterface`
  - `SqlLoanRepository`: Implements the `LoanRepositoryInterface`
  - `SqlTransactionRepository`: Implements the `TransactionRepositoryInterface`

### 2. External Services

External services implement interfaces for integration with external systems:

- **Notification Services**:
  - `EmailNotificationService`: Sends email notifications for various system events
  - `SmsNotificationService`: Sends SMS notifications for time-sensitive alerts

- **Payment Gateways**:
  - `PaymentGatewayService`: Interfaces with external payment processors

### 3. File Storage

- **FileSystemDocumentStorage**: Handles file storage operations for loan documents, customer documents, etc.

## Implementation Details

### Database Access

We use SQLAlchemy as our ORM to provide a consistent interface across different database systems. The repositories:

1. Define SQLAlchemy models that map to database tables
2. Provide methods to convert between domain entities and database models
3. Handle database connection and transaction management
4. Implement CRUD operations and queries defined in the repository interfaces

### Example: SQL Customer Repository

The `SqlCustomerRepository` implementation:

- Maps the Customer domain entity to database tables
- Implements all methods defined in the `CustomerRepositoryInterface`
- Handles database transactions and error management
- Ensures domain integrity rules are preserved

## Detailed Implementation: Loans Module

### SQL Loan Repository

The `SqlLoanRepository` implementation in the Loans module:

- Converts between Loan domain entities and database models
- Implements CRUD operations for loan entities
- Provides custom query methods for loan search and filtering
- Handles loan statistics and reporting functionality

### Notification Services

The Loans module implements two notification services:

1. **EmailNotificationService**:
   - Sends detailed loan application notifications
   - Provides loan approval and denial notifications
   - Delivers payment due and overdue reminders
   - Sends loan closure notifications with complete details
   - Supports attachments for documents

2. **SmsNotificationService**:
   - Provides concise versions of the same notifications
   - Designed for immediate awareness
   - Configurable for different SMS gateway providers

### Document Storage

The `FileSystemDocumentStorage` service:

- Stores and retrieves loan-related documents (applications, approvals, etc.)
- Maintains metadata for quick document search
- Associates documents with loan entities
- Handles document lifecycle management

### Dependency Injection

The Loans module uses a dependency injection container in `di_container.py` to:

- Configure all infrastructure components
- Provide factory methods for service instantiation
- Centralize configuration management
- Facilitate testing through component substitution

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Isolation**: Core business logic doesn't depend on infrastructure details
2. **Testability**: Easy to substitute repositories with mocks for testing
3. **Flexibility**: Database technology can be changed without affecting business logic
4. **Consistency**: Repository interfaces ensure consistent data access patterns

## Dependency Injection

Infrastructure implementations are registered with a dependency injection container, allowing the application to:

1. Resolve dependencies at runtime
2. Switch implementations based on environment or configuration
3. Maintain proper separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching Layer**: Add caching to repositories for improved performance
2. **Event Publishing**: Implement event publishers for domain events
3. **NoSQL Repositories**: Add alternative repository implementations using NoSQL databases
4. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with cloud storage providers
