# Core Banking Clean Architecture Guide

Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document provides guidance for implementing and maintaining Clean Architecture in the Core Banking module of the CBS_PYTHON system. The Core Banking module is the foundation of the banking system, handling accounts, transactions, loans, and customer financial data management.

## Module-Specific Architecture

  - CustomerFinancialRepository: Implementation of ICustomerFinancialRepository
  - LoanRepository: Implementation of ILoanRepository
  - ProductRepository: Implementation of IProductRepository
  - StatementRepository: Implementation of IStatementRepository

- **External Service Adapters**:
  - PaymentGatewayAdapter: Payment processing implementation
  - NotificationAdapter: Financial notification implementation
  - RiskAssessmentAdapter: Risk evaluation implementation
  - ComplianceAdapter: Regulatory compliance implementation
  - AuditLogAdapter: Detailed financial audit logging

- **Database Models**:
  - AccountModel: Database model for accounts
  - TransactionModel: Database model for transactions
  - CustomerFinancialModel: Database model for customer financial data
  - LoanModel: Database model for loans and loan applications
  - ProductModel: Database model for banking products
  - StatementModel: Database model for account statements
  - TransactionLogModel: Detailed transaction history model

### Presentation Layer Components

- **API Controllers**:
  - AccountController: REST endpoints for account operations
  - TransactionController: REST endpoints for transaction processing
  - LoanController: REST endpoints for loan management
  - StatementController: REST endpoints for statements
  - ProductController: REST endpoints for banking products

- **DTOs**:
  - AccountDTO: Data transfer object for account operations
  - TransactionDTO: Data transfer object for transaction operations
  - LoanDTO: Data transfer object for loan operations
  - StatementDTO: Data transfer object for account statements
  - ProductDTO: Data transfer object for banking products
  - BalanceDTO: Data transfer object for account balances

## Module-Specific Guidelines

### Domain Model Guidelines

- All financial calculations must be performed in the domain layer
- Money values must use the Money value object to prevent floating-point errors
- Account status transitions must follow the defined state machine
- All transaction operations must maintain double-entry accounting principles
- Loan calculations must follow regulatory compliance rules
- Implement proper validation for account numbers and routing codes

### Use Case Implementation

- All financial transactions must be atomic
- Implement proper error handling and transaction rollback
- Include comprehensive audit logging for all financial operations
- Use concurrency control for account balance modifications
- Implement idempotency for transaction processing
- Account statements must be generated with proper pagination and formatting
- Loan approval workflows must include multiple validation steps

### Repository Implementation

- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Implement optimistic concurrency control for account modifications
- Use appropriate indexing for performance-critical queries
- Implement data archiving strategy for historical transactions
- Ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Cache frequently accessed account data
- Use proper connection pooling for database efficiency

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for all Core Banking endpoints
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for all operations
- Include comprehensive validation for all financial inputs
- Provide detailed error responses with appropriate status codes
- Use proper pagination for large dataset queries
- Implement rate limiting for high-traffic endpoints
- Include API versioning strategy

## Module-Specific Version Control

### Branching

- Feature branches should be named: `feature/core-banking-[feature-name]`
- Bug fixes should be named: `fix/core-banking-[issue-description]`

### Commit Messages

- Include the module prefix in commit messages: `[CORE-BANKING] feat: add interest calculation algorithm`
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `[CORE-BANKING] fix: resolve transaction posting issue (#123)`
