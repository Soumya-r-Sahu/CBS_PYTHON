# Core Banking Clean Architecture Progress

Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of the Core Banking module to Clean Architecture. Core Banking is the foundational module of the CBS_PYTHON system, managing critical financial operations including accounts, transactions, loans, and customer financial data.

## Current Challenges

1. Integration with legacy transaction processing system
2. Performance optimization for high-volume transaction processing
3. Ensuring transaction atomicity across distributed systems
4. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing APIs
5. Handling complex transaction rollback scenarios

## Completed Milestones

- Established clean architecture directory structure for accounts module
- Implemented domain entities for account and transaction
- Created repository interfaces for core components
- Implemented basic account creation use case
- Completed loan entity with interest calculation

## Next Steps
1. Complete Account Domain Layer:
   - Implement account status state machine
   - Complete validation rules for all account types
   - Finalize repository interface contracts

2. Implement Transaction Processing:
   - Develop transaction validation service
   - Implement transaction processing use cases
   - Create transaction repository implementation

3. Develop Presentation Layer:
   - Design RESTful API for accounts
   - Implement account controllers
   - Create DTOs for external communication

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Transaction atomicity failures | Implement distributed transaction patterns with compensation | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Performance degradation | Benchmark and optimize critical transaction paths | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Data consistency across modules | Implement event sourcing for critical operations | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
| Regulatory compliance gaps | Regular compliance reviews with audit team | 🟡 Monitoring |
| Integration with legacy systems | Build adapter layer with comprehensive testing | 🟠 Partially Addressed |
